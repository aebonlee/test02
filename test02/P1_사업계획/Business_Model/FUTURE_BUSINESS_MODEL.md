# Future Business Model Expansions
> **Note**: These are strategic expansions to be implemented after the initial "Onboarding + Subscription" model is stabilized. The core Refund Policy (50% upon success) remains the primary incentive.

## 1. Strategic Alignment
**Goal**: Leverage the founder's "CPA/Accelerator" background to support "Continuous Growth" for users.

## 2. Proposed Revenue Streams

### A. "Seed to Scale" Investment Option (Accelerator Model)
> *For high-potential projects identified during Onboarding.*

-   **Concept**: Offer an **Equity Investment** option as an alternative or addition to the standard refund.
-   **Mechanism**:
    -   If a user achieves significant metrics (e.g., 100+ paying customers), offer to convert the 50% refund (1.5M KRW) + Additional Capital into **Seed Equity** (e.g., 1-5%).
    -   **Benefit**: Transforms the relationship from "Customer-Service Provider" to "Partner-Investor".
    -   **Why**: Builds a portfolio for the Accelerator business.

### B. SSAL Marketplace (Digital Asset Trading)
> *For the ecosystem.*

-   **Concept**: Successful users can sell their "Blueprints" (Project Grids, Prompt Chains, Design Templates).
-   **Revenue**: **Commission fee (e.g., 20-30%)** on every transaction.
-   **Benefit**: Creates a passive income stream for users and enriches the platform content.

### C. "Mastermind" Alumni Membership
> *For graduates of the Onboarding program.*

-   **Concept**: Premium networking group for active founders.
-   **Offering**:
    -   Monthly group coaching with Sunny (CPA/Accelerator).
    -   Guest speaker sessions (Legal, Marketing experts).
    -   Peer-to-peer accountability.
-   **Price**: Premium Tier Subscription (e.g., ₩100,000/month).

### D. Expert Matching (Concierge)
> *For specialized needs.*

-   **Concept**: When a founder needs specific help (Tax filing, Trademark, Advanced API integration) beyond the platform's scope.
-   **Mechanism**: Connect with vetted experts (Partners).
-   **Revenue**: **Referral fee** or **Platform fee**.

## 3. Refined Value Proposition
**"We don't just help you build a website; we invest in your business."**
-   **Build**: AI Tools & Onboarding.
-   **Grow**: Mentoring & Marketplace.
-   **Scale**: Investment & Expert Network.
